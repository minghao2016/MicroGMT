This folder contains test datasets and sample output summary tables. 

SARS-CoV-2_test_data contains fasta assembly and simulated fastq raw read files for 5 randomly selected strains of SARS-CoV-2, as well as their region information file.

E.coli_K12_test_data contains fasta assembly file of 3 randomly selected E.coli K12 strains.

The sample output summary tables contain both types of summary tables, as well as examples of reformatted tables (made by analysis_utilities.py) and examples of unqiue mutation tables (made by analysis_utilities.py).

**Note: all the sample outputs were produced by just the 5 randomly selected strains of SARS-CoV-2. So if a mutation is new or unique in the sample output, it may not be new or unique when comparing to all 34786 SARS-CoV-2 strains.**
